# digital_data_analysis_py_samples
Python samples for data analysis in Astronomy

This set of files contains examples of various packages usage designed for Astronomy in general like Astropy, Numpy, Matplotlib, etc.
The use cases are provided by Markus PÃ¶ssel in his article (the part devoted to Python) on https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13189
All the operations in the files have been tested on real data (not included here due to the volume issues)
In most cases, Spyder IDE was used along with native Python IDLE and CLI.

The set is to be supplemented further.
